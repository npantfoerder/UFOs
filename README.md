# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Project Overview
### Purpose
Dana, a data journalist, decides to write about McMinnville, her hometown in Oregon which is famous for its UFO sightings. She has a JavaScript file filled with sighting information and needs help creating the following two things: a web page that will allow users to view the data, and a dynamic table that will present it. She'd like to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results
### Performing Searches
*Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria*

*Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation*
