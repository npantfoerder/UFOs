# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Project Overview
### Purpose
Dana, a data journalist, decides to write about her hometown (McMinnville, Oregon) which is famous for its UFO sightings. She has a JavaScript file filled with sighting information and needs help creating the following two things: a web page that will allow users to view the data, and a dynamic table that will present it. She'd like to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by providing users the ability to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results
### Performing Searches
Users can perform searches by entering one or more criteria into the 'Filter Search' form. Each input box has a placeholder of an example search so that users know the format to use. When a user enters text into an input box and presses Enter or clicks anywhere else on the web page, the data table will automatically update to match the new criteria. One possible filtering process is outlined below.

1. This is how the web page looks before entering any search criteria.

2. After entering 'el cajon' into the city filter, the web page will look like this.

3. Putting 'light' into the shape filter will give the following results.
